    <h1>Cold Beet Soup</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> It is really difficult to imagine summer without this soup in Lithuania. Usually, if you start making cold beet soup it means the summer has come, or the weather is warm enough that your body itself asks for a cold beet soup (of course, it’s only for Lithuanians). Cold beet soup is made in each Lithuanian kitchen in their own way, but the essence of the recipe is always the same – kefir (or buttermilk), beetroots, cucumbers, onion greens and dill. And of course, cold beet soup is always served with a hard boiled egg and hot potatoes (boiled or fried).</p>
    <p>To Lithuanians, the cold beet soup cult is well-known from the childhood, but to foreigners this soup looks very interesting. For most, it’s incomprehensible why this soup is eaten cold, why is the color so pink or why the soup is made from kefir..? Well, and other similar questions… But of course, cold beet soup can be liked or disliked only after you try it.</p>
    <p> Enjoy everyone!</p>

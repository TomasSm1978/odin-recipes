    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cepelinai is a Lithuanian national dish which consists of large “dumplings” made from a mixture of raw and cooked potato dough filled with pork or curd. Also, it is covered generously with sour cream and bacon. </p>
    <p>The variation of the cepelinai filling may include vegetables, picked mushrooms, cheese curd with mint. Also, the sauce depends on the cook’s imagination. Although, the traditional recipe is with pork and sour cream.</p>
    <p>The main reason cepelinai is so fatty is that it was meant to feed hungry workers or to help survive cold winters. The crazy thing is that cepelinai was named after Graff von Zeppelin because those dumplings look just like the airship he invented.</p>

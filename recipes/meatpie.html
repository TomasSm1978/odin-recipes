    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Kibinas (or Lithuanian meat pie) is a particularly popular snack in Lithuania. I am sure, if you visit any town in Lithuania you’ll find at least one place where you can buy kibinas. Very often you can buy them still warm in a supermarket or buy frozen ones and bake at home. Kibinas is the pastry that is suitable for any occasion and any time of the day, whether you want to have breakfast, lunch or dinner. Kibinai can be a main dish, and a snack, since they are tasty both hot and cold.</p>
    <p>Many times I made kibinai according to this recipe (I made them at least 20 times). Kibinai come out really soft and very tasty baking according to this recipe. For me personally, these kibinai are much tastier than any bought ones. If you are making these pastries for more people, then I suggest to double the portion, because when you try one of these, after it is very difficult not to taste the second, or third one… Prepared pastries can be frozen (only don’t brush them with egg wash) and later you can bake them whenever you want ( thaw them and brush with egg yolk before baking).</p>
    <p> Yum, yum, yum!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For dough</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>~500 g (1-1.1 lb) all purpose flour</li>
        <li>225 g (2 sticks) margarine, at room temperature (like “Imperial“)</li>
        <li>1/3 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. fine salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500 g (1.1 lb) favorite ground meat (I usually use pork)</li>
        <li>1 heaped tbsp. sour cream</li>
        <li>1 medium size onion</li>
        <li>1 tsp. dried marjoram</li>
        <li>salt, black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The dough – in one bowl whisk 2 eggs and 1 egg white with 1/2 tsp. of salt and 3 tbsp. of sour cream. Reserve 1 egg yolk for pastry coating. Mix margarine with eggs. After, add little by little the flour and knead the dough. You should add that much flour until the dough still sticks to your hands, but it’s elastic. If you add too much of flour, the pastries might be too hard. When the dough is done, form the ball and put it in the bowl, cover with plastic wrap and leave it in the fridge for at least one hour, or place in the freezer for ~30 minutes. The dough can be left in the refrigerator overnight as well.</li>
        <li>Filling – mix the meat with sour cream, marjoram, salt and pepper according to your taste (I usually add ~2/3 tsp. of salt and 0,5 tsp. of black peppers). Chop the onions in small pieces and add to the filling, mix well.</li>
        <li>Mix egg yolk with 1 tbsp. of water.</li>
        <li>When the dough is ready – begin to form pastries. Take a piece of dough, roll it out on a lightly floury surface and using a desired size of cup press the circles. You can make one half of small pastries, and another half – bigger ones. When you roll out the dough, use very little of flour that pastries wouldn’t be too hard. The thickness of rolled out dough should be about 0,3-0,4 cm. I always make half portion of small size pastries, and another half – bigger ones. In the middle of each dough circle put about 1 tbsp. of the filling (elongated) and press well the sides together on the top (elongated too). Grease the baking tray with margarine or butter. Put the pastries on it. Leave couple centimetres between each pastry, that they wouldn’t stick together while baking. When all pastries are on the baking tray, then make a little curly string on each pastry from the pressed edges. Lightly brush the top of the pastries with the egg yolk.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200 C. Bake pastries for about 30 minutes, until they will trun nicely brown. Kibinai are tasty hot and cold. Enjoy your meal!</li>
